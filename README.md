# odin-recipes
As I am learning how to become a full stack developer through the odin project, one of my assignments is to build a recipe webesite. 

Although I am still new to HTML, I am eager to start this project. By the end, I want to illustrate my ability to write in HTML, organizing the website, through paragraphs, headers and having relative and absolute links.
